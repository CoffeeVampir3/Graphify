# Turn Anything Into a Graph!

Graphify is an ultra-lightweight Unity Api for quickly and easily making anything into a graph! It's 100% built using Unity's new UI Toolkit, and allows users to easily extend the graph using their own UI Toolkit code. Graphify has been designed for speed, consistenting of a virtualization scheme and fast evaluation means you can create and run thousands of graphs at a time with no issues.

## Realtime Playmode Debugging and Editing

Say goodbye to recompiling! With Graphify you're able to visualize a graph while it's running in playmode, and make permenant changes to it in real time!
